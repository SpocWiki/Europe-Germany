> 
> It is on the river Lusatian Neisse and is the largest town in Upper Lusatia, 
> the second-largest town in the region of  Lusatia after Cottbus, 
> and the largest town in the German part of the region of Silesia. 
> Görlitz is the easternmost town in Germany and lies opposite the Polish town of Zgorzelec, 
> which was the eastern part of Görlitz until 1945. 
> 
> The town has approximately 56,000 inhabitants, which make Görlitz the sixth-largest town in Saxony. 
> It is the seat of the district of Görlitz. Together with Zgorzelec 
> it forms the Euro City of Görlitz/Zgorzelec, which has a combined population of around 86,000.

> Görlitz, first mentioned in 1071, developed as a key trading town on the Via Regia route 
> linking Western and Eastern Europe. In the Late Middle Ages, it prospered through the cloth trade and became a member of the Lusatian League, enjoying considerable autonomy. The town came under Bohemian, Hungarian, Austrian and Saxon rule before becoming part of Prussia in 1815 after the Congress of Vienna. During World War II, Görlitz was spared major destruction, but the new Oder–Neisse line in 1945 divided it from its eastern districts, which became Zgorzelec in Poland. In the GDR era, Görlitz was a border town with limited cross-border contact, but after German reunification and Poland’s EU accession, cooperation with Zgorzelec increased. Today, Görlitz is renowned for its well-preserved historic architecture and frequent use as a film location.
>
> Görlitz is culturally diverse. Immediately to the west of Görlitz lie Sorbian-speaking parts of Lusatia, and Görlitz was founded and first settled by the Sorbs, a Slavic people. This is evidenced by the name of the town and the etymology of some of its surrounding villages and geographical features being of Slavic origin. Görlitz itself speaks the East Lusatian dialect of German (Ostlausitzer Mundart), which is related to Silesian German dialects and differs from the Upper Saxon dialects spoken in most parts of Saxony. It is home to the Schlesisches Himmelreich and Liegnitzer Bombe, a Silesian Museum (Schlesisches Museum zu Görlitz), and the Silesian Christmas Market (Schlesischer Christkindelmarkt).

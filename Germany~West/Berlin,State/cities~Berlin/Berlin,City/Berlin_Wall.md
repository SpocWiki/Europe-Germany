## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer, pronounced [bɛʁˌliːnɐ ˈmaʊɐ] ) 
> was a guarded concrete barrier that encircled West Berlin from 1961 to 1989, 
> separating it from East Berlin and the German Democratic Republic (GDR; East Germany). 
> 
> Construction of the Berlin Wall was commenced by the government of the GDR on 13 August 1961. 
> It included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area 
> (later known as the "death strip") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and other defenses. 
> The primary intention for the Wall's construction was 
> to prevent East German citizens from fleeing to the West.
>
> The Soviet Bloc propaganda portrayed the Wall as 
> protecting its population from "fascist elements conspiring to prevent the will of the people" 
> from building a communist state in the GDR. 
> 
> The authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart 
> (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall, pronounced [antifaˌʃɪstɪʃɐ ˈʃʊtsval] ). 
> 
> Conversely, West Berlin's city government sometimes referred to it as the "Wall of Shame", 
> a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt in reference to the Wall's restriction on freedom of movement. 
> Along with the separate and much longer inner German border, 
> which demarcated the border between East and West Germany, 
> it came to symbolize physically the Iron Curtain that separated the Western Bloc 
> and Soviet satellite states of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.
>
> Before the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans (20% of the population) 
> circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, 
> many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin; 
> from there they could then travel to West Germany and to other Western European countries. 
> After 1961, the deadly force associated with the Wall prevented almost all such emigration. 
> During this period, over 100,000 people attempted to escape, 
> and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall, 
> with an estimated death toll of those killed by East German authorities 
> ranging from 136 to more than 200 in and around Berlin.
>
> In 1989, a series of revolutions in nearby Eastern Bloc countries (Poland and Hungary in particular) 
> and the events of the "Pan-European Picnic" set in motion a peaceful development 
> during which the Iron Curtain largely broke, 
> rulers in the East came under public pressure to cease their repressive policies. 
> 
> After several weeks of civil unrest, 
> the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 
> that all GDR citizens could visit the FRG and West Berlin. 
> 
> Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall, 
> joined by West Germans on the other side, 
> and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall over the next few weeks. 
> 
> The Brandenburg Gate section, a few meters from the Berlin Wall, reopened on 22 December 1989, 
> with full demolition of the Wall beginning on 13 June 1990 and concluding in 1994. 
> The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for German reunification, 
> which formally took place on 3 October 1990.

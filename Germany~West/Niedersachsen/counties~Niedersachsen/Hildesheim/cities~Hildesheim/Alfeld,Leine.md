> The Fagus Factory (German: Fagus Fabrik or Fagus Werk), a shoe last factory in Alfeld on the Leine, Lower Saxony, Germany, is an important example of early modern architecture.  Commissioned by owner Carl Benscheidt who wanted a radical structure to express the company's break from the past, the factory was designed  by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer.  It was constructed between 1911 and 1913, with additions and interiors completed in 1925. Because of its influence in the development of modern architecture and outstanding design, the factory has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011.

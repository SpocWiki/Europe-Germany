## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Ostsiedlung** (German pronunciation: [ˈɔstˌziːdlʊŋ] , lit. 'East settlement') 
> is the term for the early medieval and high medieval migration of Germanic peoples 
> and Germanization of the areas populated by Slavic, Baltic and Uralic peoples; 
> the most settled area is sometimes known today as Germania Slavica. 
> 
> Germanization efforts included eastern parts of Francia, East Francia, 
> and the Holy Roman Empire and beyond; and the consequences 
> for settlement development and social structures in the areas of settlement. 
> Other regions were also settled, though not as heavily. 
> The Ostsiedlung encompassed multiple modern and historical regions, 
> primarily Germany east of the Saale and Elbe rivers, the states of Lower Austria 
> and Styria in Austria, Poland and the Czech Republic, 
> but also in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.
>
> The majority of Ostsiedlung settlers settled individually at various stages. 
> Many settlers were encouraged and invited by the local princes and regional lords, 
> who sometimes even expelled part of the indigenous populations 
> to make room for German settlers.
>
> Smaller groups of migrants first moved to the east during the early Middle Ages. 
> Larger treks of settlers, which included scholars, monks, missionaries, 
> craftsmen and artisans, often invited, in numbers unverifiable, 
> first moved eastwards during the mid-12th century. 
> 
> The military territorial conquests and punitive expeditions 
> of the Ottonian and Salian emperors during the 11th and 12th centuries 
> do not form part of the Ostsiedlung, 
> as these actions did not result in noteworthy settlement establishment 
> east of the Elbe and Saale rivers. 
> 
> The Ostsiedlung is considered to have been a purely Medieval event 
> as it ended in the beginning of the 14th century. 
> The legal, cultural, linguistic, religious and economic changes 
> caused by the movement had a profound influence on the history of 
> Eastern Central Europe between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathians until the 20th century.
>
> In the 20th century, accounts of the Ostsiedlung 
> were heavily exploited by German nationalists (including the Nazi movement) 
> to press the territorial claims of Germany 
> and to demonstrate supposed German superiority over non-Germanic peoples, 
> whose cultural, urban and scientific achievements in that era were 
> undermined, rejected, or presented as German. 
> 
> After World War I (1914–1918), the fact that 
> Germany and Austria lost part of their territories in the East 
> appeared as a counterpoint to Ostsiedlung 
> because some of the Germans in the East became foreign citizens 
> when their homes were no longer part of Germany and Austria. 
> 
> The Germans in the East outside Germany and Austria were partially forced to leave 
> and the regions that Germany and Austria lost in the East 
> were dominated by non-German peoples, 
> so the German loss here was not as severe as after World War II.
>
> In and after World War II (1944–1950), Germans were driven out 
> and deported to rump Germany from the East 
> and their language and culture were lost in most areas 
> (including the German-dominated lands which Germany lost after this war) 
> in which German people had settled during the Ostsiedlung; 
> except part of Eastern Austria and especially Eastern Germany.
